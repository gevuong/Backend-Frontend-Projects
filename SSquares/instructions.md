0. review the mockup png file
1. create the HTML structure that displays a letter S with squares

2. each large square should be sized 50px by 50px with a solid black border of 1px and a background of white

3. horizontally, each large square should be positioned 50 px away from each other

4. vertically, each large square should be positioned 30px away from each other

5. the center square has no vertical gap between its immediate top-left and bottom-right neighbors

6. the small square should be of size 20px by 20px with a background #57D497 and a solid black border of 1px

7. the small square should be overlapping the right border of top-right large square and it's positioned, vertically, in the middle of the large square

8. the right-most edge of the top-right large square should go through the middle of the width of the small square

9. when each of the large squares is clicked, the background of the clicked large square will change from white to blue (#33C6E4)

10. if any large square is clicked when its background is not white, it will toggle back to white

11. when the background color of all the large squares has changed to blue:
  a. the big squares will toggle back to white one by one, in the reverse order of which they turned to blue in, with a 300ms delay in between each color change
  b. after all the big squares turn back to white, no reactions will happen when clicking on any of the big squares
