HTML Email Production
-----------------------

Please convert the attached .psd file ("MWD-Developer-Test-PSD.psd") to an HTML email that will render well across all major email clients and web browsers. 

Try to minimize the number of image slices used, while converting as much of the email content to text/code as possible.

There is a "comp" contained in the testing kit for a quick preview of the design file.

The client logo should be hyperlinked, directing to: http://www.seti.org/ , and the 'donate now' buttons and blue text should direct to: https://seti.org/donate

All other links, including social media icons, should use a placeholder link of your choosing. 

The HTML email should be responsive (or fluid) to the best of your abilities.

Send the email back to us when you're done.

Feel free to ask any questions while you work on this.

This should be completed within (about) 1 week.
