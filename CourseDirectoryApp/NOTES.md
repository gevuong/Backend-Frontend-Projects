### Trivia Notes
* Setting up routes allows you to navigate parts of website by manually inputting URL. Setting up links allows you to click on a link to navigate website.
* JS frameworks, like Angular and Ember, come with built-in routing features. React is not a framework, but a library concerned with rendering UI. React is a declarative and modular style of building UIs.
* This app will be a **single page apps (or SPA)**, displayed only on a single web page. The HTML, CSS, and JS are only loaded once on the browser, and content **changes dynamically** as user interacts with app, provides a smoother browsing experience. App never reloads unless user manually refreshes.
* Routing is responsible for matching URL with the set of components being rendered, and loading and unloading content. The router finds components that correspond with, for example, the sign-up URL and loads them on screen.
* A good dependable routing solution should also keep track of **browser history**
to keep the UI in sync with the URL. That way users can navigate the app using the browser's back and forward buttons.
* Routing in single-page apps should work in a way that's consistent with the navigation experience of regular multi-page sites and apps.
* **Routing** is the process of matching a URL to a View, or a set of components being rendered. In single-page apps, **routing dynamically loads components and changes what's displayed in the browser**, as users navigate the app.
**All without reloading the page.**
* React Itself doesn't have built in routing features. So many developer rely on React Router, an external library designed specifically for React.

* Pure or stateless components are simply functions with a render method and no state. These components don't initialize or change the state.

* React Router uses JSX syntax to declare routes. React Router is a set of components, and the declarative syntax of JSX makes it easier to visualize how routes are structured.
