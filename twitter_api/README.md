We are going to attempt to build a complete twitter bot with 3 API integrations in two hours!
We'll start with a blank file and see how far we can get! We may not finish but it will be a good exercise in writing a larger python project. We'll be doing our best to code beautiful, functional python, with separation of concerns, architecture, and unit tests.
