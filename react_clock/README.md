### Setup
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Open index.html

Using React, build a digital clock that displays the current (west coast) time (non-military).

### Clarifying points
- You can only get current time once.
- You must display hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM.
- Try not to use external resources, but if you must, you can only use MDN and React docs.
- Style it as best as you can within the allotted time.
- You have 60 minutes to complete this (please set a timer).
Bonus: Add an alarm

### Hints
dateObj.getHours() returns the hour from 0 to 23.
Numbers should be padded with zeroes (ie. 02:45:06, not 2:45:6)
