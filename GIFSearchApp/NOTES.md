* React is just a view library, and it's only concern is rendering components using state and properties passed to them. React doesn't have a built in way to fetch data from a server. React doesn't know there is a server.
* There are JS methods used to fetch data to React app. Both of the following methods use promise to handle results we get back from the server:
  * Fetch API: A modern replacement for XMLHTTPRequest, it is a data fetching interface that's native to the browser. 
  * Axios: Similar to Fetch API.
